name: Moe's Tavern
description: Moe's Tavern, once known as Moe's Bar is the local tavern in Springfield. The bar is named after its owner, Moe Szyslak. It is the only tavern in Springfield (maybe because, like Krusty and Krusty Burger, Moe pays Fat Tony money to make sure there is no competition).
address: Moe's Tavern is located on Walnut Street, next to King Toot's Music Store.
