# Slowfood-oct18-team1
This is an Online Food Ordering System - a web-based application that allows customers to order their food for home delivery, or for pick up from the restaurant. Our imaginary client is a restaurant owner that needs a website where he can list his menu and allow visitors to place orders.
## Objectives
The main objective for this challenge is to practice the workflow that we want to use in our projects with a focus on:

- Agile methods for software development
- Collaboration using Git and GitHub
- Test Driven Development and Behavior Driven Design
## Tools
- Ruby on Rails as web framework
- Cartify a gem for order functionality and check out flow
- Devise for user authentication and account management
- Tailwind CSS as CSS framework
- PostgreSQL as a database with ActiveRecord as ORM
- Cucumber for Acceptance tests
- RSpec for Unit tests
- GitHub to store your code and make it available for the entire team
- Pivotal Tracker as Project Management tool for tracking Features, Chores, and Bugs.
